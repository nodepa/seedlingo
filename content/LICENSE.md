Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
intended for use by those authorized to give the public
permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
licensed material, or material used under an exception or
limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors

Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
the licensed material may still be restricted for other
reasons, including because others have copyright or other
rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations

Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License ("Public
License"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a

   Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material
   and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,
   arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
   permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
   Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed

   specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
   Rights.

e. **Effective Technological Measures** means those measures that, in the
   absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
   fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright
   Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
   agreements.

f. **Exceptions and Limitations** means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
   any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
   that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.

   of a Creative Commons Public License. The License Elements of this

   under this Public License.

k. **Share** means to provide material to the public by any means or

   dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
   available to the public including in ways that members of the
   public may access the material from a place and at a time
   individually chosen by them.

l. **Sui Generis Database Rights** means rights other than copyright
   resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of

   as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
   equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

m. **You** means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
   under this Public License. **Your** has a corresponding meaning.


## Section 2 -- Scope.

### a. License grant.
1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
   the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
   non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
   exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

   a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
      in part; and

   b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

2. *Exceptions and Limitations.* For the avoidance of doubt, where
   Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
   License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
   its terms and conditions.

3. *Term.* The term of this Public License is specified in Section
   6(a).

4. *Media and formats; technical modifications allowed.* The
   Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
   all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
   and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
   Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
   authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
   necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
   technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
   Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
   simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
   (4) never produces Adapted Material.

5. *Downstream recipients.*

   a. *Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material.* Every
      recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
      receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
      Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
      Public License.

   b. *Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material.*
      Every recipient of Adapted Material from You
      automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to
      exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material
      under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.

   c. *No downstream restrictions.* You may not offer or impose
      any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
      apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
      Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
      Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
      Material.

6. *No endorsement.* Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
   may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
   are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
   with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
   the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
   provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

### b. Other rights.

1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
   licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
   privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
   the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
   assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
   extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
   Rights, but not otherwise.

2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
   Public License.

3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
   collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
   Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
   under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
   licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
   reserves any right to collect such royalties.


## Section 3 -- License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
following conditions.

### a. Attribution.

1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
   form), You must:

   A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
      with the Licensed Material:

        i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
          Material and any others designated to receive
          attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
          the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
          designated);

        ii. a copyright notice;

        iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

        iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
            warranties;

        v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
          extent reasonably practicable;

   B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
      retain an indication of any previous modifications; and

   C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
      Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
      hyperlink to, this Public License.

2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
   reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
   which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
   reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
   hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
   information.

3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
   information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
   reasonably practicable.

### b. ShareAlike.

In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share
Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.

1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons
   license with the same License Elements, this version or
   later, or a BY-SA Compatible License.

2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the
   Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition
   in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and
   context in which You Share Adapted Material.

3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms
   or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological
   Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the
   rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.


## Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
   to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
   portion of the contents of the database;

b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
   contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
   Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
   Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material,
   including for purposes of Section 3(b); and

c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
   all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.


## Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

a. **UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
   EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
   AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
   ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
   IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
   WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
   PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
   ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
   KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
   ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.**

b. **TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
   TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
   NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
   INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
   COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
   USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
   ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
   DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
   IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.**

c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
   above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
   possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
   waiver of all liability.


## Section 6 -- Term and Termination.

a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
   Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
   this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
   terminate automatically.

b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
   Section 6(a), it reinstates:

  1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
    it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
    violation; or

  2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
of this Public License.

c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
   Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
   distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
   will not terminate this Public License.

d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
   License.


## Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.

a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
   terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
   Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
   independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.


## Section 8 -- Interpretation.

a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
   shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
   conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
   be made without permission under this Public License.

b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
   deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
   minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
   cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
   without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
   conditions.

c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
   failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
   Licensor.

d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
   as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
   that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
   processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
