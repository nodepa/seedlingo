## What is Seedlingo

Seedlingo is a digital language learning tool
targeting adults learning to read their native language.

A teacher or content developer
can prepare tailored units of exercises
from Seedlingo's templates
to provide skill-adjusted assignments
to a fluent listener
learning to read the language.

Current exercise types are:

- multiple-choice
  - select text by audio cue
  - select text by short phrase/synonym/explanation
- matching
  - match text to audio cue 4-by-4
  - match text to phrase/synonym/explanation 3-by-3
- cloze
  - select text that matches the missing bit in a sentence
  - select multiple text fragments
    that match multiple missing bits in a sentence
- comprehension
  - read a short paragraph or two,
    then answer questions about the the text,
    before practicing newly introduced words or fragments
    using multiple-choice or matching,
    then finally review the original text

Developing a content editor is high on the list of priorities.

Seedlingo was originally developed as
[立爱种字 LiAiZhongzi.com](https://liaizhongzi.com)
from ideas by [立爱教育 Li Ai Education](https://liaieducation.com),
to help Putonghua speaking adults
learn to read simplified Chinese characters.

To try the Android app, [download version 1.5.2](
  https://github.com/nodepa/seedlingo/releases/download/v1.5.2/seedlingo_v1.5.2_64.apk
) or check the [release history](https://github.com/nodepa/seedlingo/releases)
for a more recent version.
Download to your phone, then install.
You may have to enable the setting "Install from unknown sources"
before your phone will allow the installation.

There is also an English language version available for demonstration purposes
[online at en.seedlingo.app](https://en.seedlingo.app)
or [downloadable for Android](https://github.com/nodepa/seedlingo-en/releases).

## Get started

### Prerequisites

- Install [git](https://git-scm.com) if not present.
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), which includes
  [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (Node Package Manager).

  - If you *do not* use [Volta](https://volta.sh/),
    **use the version specified in the `volta`-section of `package.json`**
    when installing [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) according to your preference.

  - If you *do* use [Volta](https://volta.sh/),
    the `package.json`-specified Node version
    will automatically be installed and used
    when commands are executed.

### Development setup

on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or equivalent.
