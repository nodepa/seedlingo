# Content

The Seedling app fetches content from the `content/` folder.
The content consist of

- a root `ContentPack.json` specification used by Seedling to identify the rest of the content
- a word-list describing words and their corresponding media like icons, pictures and audio
- media files
- lesson specifications describing units of exercises of which words to practice by what exercise type
- audio files giving the users instructions about how to interact and progress

If you want to deploy Seedling with your own content,
follow the [Replace default content](replace-content.md)-guide.
The content must be formatted according to the [Content specification](content-spec.md).
