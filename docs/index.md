## What is Seedling?

Seedling is a digital learning tool for adults;
a collection of exercise templates
that bundled content can use
to present curated lessons
for first-language learners.

[Li Ai Education](https://liaieducation.com) used Seedling
to make [立爱种字](https://种字.com),
to help [Standard Chinese (Putonghua)](
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Chinese) speaking adults
learn to read simplified Chinese characters.
