## What is Seedlingo?

Seedlingo is a digital language learning tool
targeting adults learning to read their native language.

::: tip &nbsp;
A teacher or content developer
can prepare tailored units of exercises
from Seedlingo's templates
to provide skill-adjusted assignments
to a fluent listener
learning to read the language.
:::

Seedlingo was originally developed and made available on the web as
[Á´ãÁà±ÁßçÂ≠ó LiAiZhongzi.com](https://liaizhongzi.com)
from ideas by [Á´ãÁà±ÊïôËÇ≤ Li Ai Education](https://liaieducation.com),
to help Putonghua speaking adults
learn to read Simplified Chinese characters.

Seedlingo is also available with [English demo content](https://en.seedlingo.app),
i.e. the original Simplified Chinese content
has been replaced with English content
for demonstration purposes.
